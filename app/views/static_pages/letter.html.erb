<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
  Hello. My name is Shenil, and I am the founder of Alphabeats. We aim to help uncover the many talented artists living amongst us and help them become popular. In our case, we focus on musicians.
</p>

<h2>What</h2>
<p>
<b>
  Alphabeats allows independent musicians to raise money against the earnings of a song's digital income. The digital income includes proceeds from popular streaming channels such as Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and Deezer.
</b>  
</p>

<p>
  "Equity crowdfunding" is the technical term used to describe this business model. I like to think of Alphabeats as a crowdsourced record label with no strings attached. By this, I'm referring to the fact that artists raise money on a per song basis, which has the following implications for the artist and the potential investors:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Artist</th>
  <th>Potential Investors</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1. Artists do not have to put all of their songs on the platform, or share income of newer songs with investors</td>
  <td>1. Investors do not need to rely on the artist producing new work, nor does the quality of other work have a direct impact on that particular song's performance.</td>   
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2. The funding request will be of smaller amounts, allowing most fans to take part in investing</td>
  <td>2. Investors' benefits are tied only to the song that they invest in, making it easier to decide the value of their investment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3. Artists do not have a long term commitment with their investors</td>
  <td>3. The cost of investing is much lower, making the experience more about discovering great music instead of a worrysome.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Who</h2>
<p>
  If you are a musician, here are some ways you can use Alphabeats to advance in the industry. Firstly, you can use Alphabeats to gain traction for your work to increase your chances of signing with a major record label eventually. Alternatively, you can use Alphabeats to become popular and stay independent. We are currently offering one year free subscription for all Irish artists and bands.
</p>
<p>
  On the other end, investing may be of interest if you are a music connoisseur, an aspiring record label executive, or a finance savy person looking for something unique. Whichever category you fit into, what compares to making money using your favorite streaming service and social media platforms?
</p>

<h2>How</h2>
<p>
Now that I've touched upon what our aim and idea is, and why I'm doing this, here are the steps of the business model so you can understand how it works:
</p>
<p>
Step 1: The musician submits a song through Alphabeats. We put the song on major streaming services through our partner aggregator, <a href="https://distrokid.com">DistroKid</a>. Once the song is approved and uploaded, the artist can make an investment request, asking for money in return for a portion of the song's earnings.
</p>
<p>
Step 2: Fans of the song can invest in it, giving them a claim of the song's income. This motivates them to share the song to others (from their preferred streaming service). As more people download or stream the song, the artist and the song's investors will receive higher payouts and the song will climb ranks in the well known streaming platforms. 
</p>
<p>
Step 3: Soon the song's payouts will exceed the amount the investor gave, giving them an income opportunity. Alternatively, the investor can sell their claim of income of the song to other investors on the Alphabeats marketplace. More importantly, the song will be exposed to a wider audience in the process, and create more fans for the future! 
</p>

<h2>You</h2>
<p>
I look forward to your questions, feedback, or "Hello" messages.
