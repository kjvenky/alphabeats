	<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq1" class="question"><span class="glyphiconstyle glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>&nbsp;What is Alphabeats?</h3>
<p id="faq1" class="collapse demo faq-text-style">

	<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq2"><span class="glyphiconstyle glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>&nbsp;How does it work?</h3>
<p id="faq2" class="collapse demo faq-text-style">
Artists upload their song on their Alphabeats account. Then, with the help of our chosen aggregator, <a href="https://distrokid.com/">Distrokid</a>, we put the song on all major streaming services - giving the artist (or relevant rightholders) the royalty payments. Musicians can request funding in exchange for the future royalty earnings of a song. Influencers (bloggers, audiophiles, labels) can then bid to invest in the song in a stock market like interface. <br><br>

This creates magic. By investing in a song, influencers create an opportunity to earn fun money. Obviously, the more that they promote the song, the more they are likely to gain from their investment - creating a win-win situation for all: <br>
1. Through the promotion efforts led by influencers, musicians gain exposure to new audiences <br>  
2. Influencers can make some money in a fun way, as well as establish themselves as music curators <br>
3. Audiences are more likely to discover hidden talents in the music industry <br>
