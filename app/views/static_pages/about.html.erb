    <p>Alphabeats gives music bloggers, audiophiles and record labels the opportunity to invest in songs of unsigned and rising artists.</p> <br>
    <h4>How it Works</h4>
    <p>
      Artists upload their song on their Alphabeats account. Then, with the help of our chosen aggregator, <a href="https://distrokid.com/">Distrokid</a>, we put the song on all major streaming services - giving the artist (or relevant rightholders) the royalty payments.
