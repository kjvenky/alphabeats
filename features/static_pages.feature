Feature: Static Pages of the website
	In order to learn about the music application
	As a visitor
	I want to access different pages in the website
	
	The value addition of this feature is informing visitors of
	the application and help onboarding them.

# Scenario Outline: Interlinking between pages
	# Given I am on <page1>
	# When I click on <word>
	# Then I should go to <page2>

	# Examples:
	# 	| page1 | word | page2 |
	# 	| Home Page | "Letter from founder" | Letter from founder |
